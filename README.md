## Task 8: Setting Up a VPN and Exploring Its Privacy Benefits

### Steps Followed

1. **Choose a Reputable Free VPN Service**
   - Selected ProtonVPN (free tier) / Windscribe (free).

2. **Sign Up and Download**
   - Created a free account using a valid email.
   - Downloaded and installed VPN client software from the official site.

3. **Connect to a VPN Server**
   - Launched the VPN app.
   - Choose a server location (closest or specific country).
   - Connected to the VPN—verified successful connection in the app.

4. **Verify IP Address Has Changed**
   - Used https://whatismyipaddress.com to check public IP before and after VPN connection.
   - Confirmed IP address changed (shows VPN server location).

5. **Test Traffic Encryption**
   - Browsed a random website eg: ( www.amazon.in ) while connected to VPN.
   - Confirmed data sent between my device and the site was encrypted (VPN indicator on).

6. **Compare Browsing Speeds**
   - Browsed some sites with VPN enabled; noted the speed.
   - Disconnected VPN and browsed again to compare speed and see local IP restored.

7. **Research VPN Encryption and Privacy Features**
   - VPN uses tunneling protocols (e.g., OpenVPN, WireGuard) to encrypt data.
   - Encryption scrambles data so it can’t be understood by snoopers or ISPs.

8. **Summary of VPN Benefits and Limitations**
   - **Benefits:**
     - Encrypts internet traffic for privacy
     - Masks real IP address, helps bypass region blocks
     - Protects data on public Wi-Fi
   - **Limitations:**
     - Free VPNs may be slower or have data limits
     - Some sites block VPN traffic
     - VPN does not guarantee complete anonymity
